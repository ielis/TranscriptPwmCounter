# Sample file with PWM definition
# '---' separates individual PWMs
# 3 required fields are: [name, threshold, matrix]
# 	- name will be included in result
#	- result will not be included if its score is lower than threshold value
#	- matrix - each column corresponds to position in evaluated sequence
#		- rows represent position weights for nucleotides in this order: A,C,G,T
